// What would be the output of the following code and why
let myNumber = 0;
if (myNumber = 10) {
	console.log('Hacked!')
}
console.log(myNumber)

/*
The out ptu is 10 and hacked because we use let by set value of myNumber to 0 at initial point 
then we reassign it in condition that is why we will get 10 and Hacked! at output
