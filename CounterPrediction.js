// let counter = 0

// for (console.log("Hi"); counter < 4; console.log("Hello")){
//   counter++ 
// }
// We will get Hi at the first time and at the second we will get Hello up to fifth.Hello
// This because the loop is looping 4 times and there is fifth on that has not condition on it.
let counter = 6

for (console.log("Hi"); counter < 4; console.log("Hello")){
  counter++

// we will get Hi only bacause condition will not be greater than counter.
